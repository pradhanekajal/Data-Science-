# # To Analyze the user Funnel by using the python 
# #User Funnel Analysis - a way to understand how users interact with a website or an application. 
# #By tracking user flow as they move through various stages of the funnel, companies can identify areas where users are giving up or getting stuck.
# #This enables them to take action to improve user experience and increase conversion. 
# #For example, if a lot of users leave the website after adding items to the cart, the company may look for ways to make the checkout process faster and easier.

#The stage column contains the stages of the flow of the users. 
#For example, when you visit Amazon, the first stage will be the homepage of Amazon, 
#and the last page will be the page where you proceed with the payment.

# From Above Analysis we can see the users on home page is quit volatile.
#from homepage to purchase the conversion is 1.3% only
